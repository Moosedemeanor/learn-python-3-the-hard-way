# a comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# anything after the # is ignored by Python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# you can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
# study drills
# i was correct about commenting out code
